                            the seasons, El evolves from a frightened, mute child into a powerful young woman trying to
                            find her identity independent of her powers. She has saved the world multiple times, closing
                            the Gate and battling the Mind Flayer, but her journey is defined by her desire for a normal
                            life and the love she holds for her chosen family.
