                        On November 6, 1983, 12-year-old Will Byers vanishes on his way home after a game of Dungeons &
                        Dragons. His disappearance unearths a dark secret lurking beneath the surface of Hawkins. His
                        mother, Joyce, becomes convinced he is communicating through the electricity in her home, while
                        Police Chief Jim Hopper uncovers a conspiracy at Hawkins National Laboratory involving a young
                        girl with telekinetic powers named Eleven.
                        <br><br>
                        Eleven escapes the lab and is found by Will's friends—Mike, Dustin, and Lucas. They hide her in
                        Mike's basement, and she reveals that Will is trapped in a dark, parallel dimension she calls
                        the "Upside Down," hunted by a faceless monster they dub the "Demogorgon." Meanwhile, Will's
                        brother Jonathan and Mike's sister Nancy team up to hunt the monster after it takes Nancy's best
                        friend, Barb.

                        The season culminates in a convergence at the middle school. Eleven sacrifices herself to
                        disintegrate the Demogorgon, vanishing in the process. Joyce and Hopper enter the Upside Down to
                        rescue Will, pulling him from the alien vines just in time. Life seems to return to normal, but
                        Will coughs up a slug-like creature, revealing that the connection to the Upside Down is far
                        from severed.

                        Set around Halloween 1984, a year after Will's rescue, Hawkins is still recovering. Will is
                        suffering from "episodes" where he flashes into the Upside Down, seeing a colossal Shadow
                        Monster (the Mind Flayer) looming over the town. Hopper has been secretly hiding Eleven in a
                        cabin in the woods to protect her from the government, causing tension between her and Mike, who
                        calls her on the radio every night.
                        <br><br>
                        A new girl, Max, arrives in town, shaking up the boys' dynamic. Dustin finds a strange creature
                        he names Dart, which grows into a "Demodog" and reveals that the Upside Down is spreading via a
                        network of tunnels beneath the town. Will becomes possessed by the Mind Flayer, acting as its
                        spy.
                        <br><br>
                        The group realizes they must burn the virus out of Will and close the Gate to kill the hive
                        mind. Eleven returns from a journey of self-discovery (where she meets another test subject,
                        Eight) to save her friends. While Joyce overheats Will to expel the entity, Eleven channels her
                        rage to seal the massive rift at Hawkins Lab. The season ends with the Snow Ball dance, but the
                        Mind Flayer watches ominously from the Upside Down, still alive.

                        It's the summer of 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of life in Hawkins,
                        putting local stores out of business. Romance is in the air for Mike and Eleven, much to
                        Hopper's chagrin. However, the Mind Flayer has found a way back. It begins possessing rats and
                        eventually people, starting with Max's stepbrother, Billy Hargrove, to build a physical body
                        capable of killing Eleven.

                        Dustin, Steve, Robin, and Lucas's sister Erica discover a secret Soviet base beneath the mall.
                        They learn the Russians are trying to reopen the Gate. Meanwhile, Nancy and Jonathan investigate
                        a story about rabid rats that leads them to the "Flayed."
                        <br><br>
                        The season climaxes in the Battle of Starcourt. The kids fight the massive Flesh Monster in the
                        mall atrium using fireworks. Eleven loses her powers after being bitten. In the Russian bunker
                        below, Hopper and Joyce try to destroy the machine keeping the Gate open. Billy sacrifices
                        himself to save Eleven from the Mind Flayer. Hopper appears to perish in the explosion to close
                        the Gate. The Byers family and a powerless Eleven move away from Hawkins, splitting up the
                        party.

                        Spring 1986. The group is scattered: Eleven and the Byers are in California, Hopper is a
                        prisoner in Russia, and the rest are in Hawkins. A new threat, Vecna, begins gruesomely
                        murdering teenagers in Hawkins, opening a small gate with each kill. He targets those with
                        hidden trauma, eventually setting his sights on Max.
                        <br><br>
                        In California, Eleven is taken by Dr. Brenner to the "Nina Project" to regain her powers by
                        reliving her repressed memories. She discovers that Vecna is actually Henry Creel (One), the
                        orderly who tricked her into freeing him. In Russia, Joyce and Murray launch a daring rescue
                        mission to break Hopper out of the gulag, fighting a Demogorgon in the process.
                        <br><br>
                        The Hawkins group enters the Upside Down to kill Vecna while he is in a trance. Eddie Munson
                        distracts the Demobats with a metal concert but dies protecting the town. Eleven "piggybacks"
                        into Max's mind to fight Vecna psychically. They manage to injure him, but Max is clinically
                        dead for a minute, allowing the fourth gate to open. The four gates tear through Hawkins,
                        causing a massive "earthquake." Max is left in a coma, and the season ends with the Upside Down
                        bleeding into the real world, setting the stage for the final battle.
